hyphi version 1.0
================================================================================

Installation:

hyphi relies on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), available at 
https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ .  Once this has been installed, edit the 
PATHS variable in Makefile to include the locations of the GSL headers and 
libraries.  Then compile hyphi using "make" from the command prompt.

Parallelization in hyphi uses OpenMP.  The code may be compiled without 
parallelization by deleting the "-fopenmp" flag in the Makefile.

hyphi can use the Mira-Titan IV emulator of Moran et al., MNRAS 520:3443 (2023),
e-Print arXiv:2207.12345 , available online at github.com/lanl/CosmicEmu .  
Its location should be symlinked to the working directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running:

hyphi is run directly from the command prompt with no arguments.  It requires:

  1.  a file params_hyphi.dat listing the cosmological parameters and 
      code inputs, as detailed in the comments to the sample 
      params_hyphi.dat file included; 

  2.  transfer function files at the redshifts specified by the user in 
      params_hyphi.dat, in the standard 13-column format produced by the CAMB 
      code (https://camb.info), and named as specified in params_hyphi.dat; and

  3.  a copy of (or symlink to) the Mita-Titan IV emulator of Moran, et al. 
      (2023) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12345], in the working directory.

Since the bulk of the computational cost is due to the Time-RG perturbation 
theory describing the non-linear clustering of the cold dark matter and baryons,
hyphi can compute multiple lensing potential power spectra in parallel for very
little additional cost.  We have tested this by computing 1000 lensing potential
power spectra at once, with only a modest 40% increase in running time.

A sample params_hyphi.dat and the corresponding CAMB transfer function files
are included with the code.  Also included is the shell script runAll, which
symlinks the Mira-Titan IV emulator for use with hyphi, runs CAMB with user-
specified parameters, and calls hyphi using the CAMB transfer files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hydrodynamic effects:

Modeling of the baryonic suppression of matter clustering uses my C++
implementation of the SP(k) fitting function of Salcido, et al., MNRAS 523:2247
(2023) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09710], and available online at 
https://github.com/jemme07/pyspk .  SP(k) models a correction factor for
baryonic effects using the relative baryon fraction as a function of halo mass
and redshift, which must be provided as an input.  Three options are 
implemented in hyphi:

  0.  no hydrodynamic suppression;

  1.  the baryon fraction measured from the BAHAMAS simulations of McCarthy,
      et al., MNRAS 465:2936 (2017) and MNRAS 476:2999 (2018) 
      [https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02702 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02411],
      raised to a power p_f chosen by the user in params_hyphi.dat, and then
      fed to SP(k); and

  2.  a variant of the three-parameter baryon fraction of Akino, et al., 
      PASJ 74:175 (2022) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10080], as implemented in
      SP(k), with the three parameters supplied by the user in params_hyphi.dat.

Note that when calculating multiple lensing potential power spectra at once, 
three parameters must be supplied for each spectrum.  All three are neglected
as dummy parameters if option 0 above is chosen, and the final two are neglected
if option 1 is chosen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outputs:

hyphi prints the CMB lensing potential power spectra requested by the user
in params_hyphi.dat as separate columns at each requested output redshift.  
Legendre moment values L are approximately logarithmically spaced, but with
the restriction that they be integers.  By default, 128 L values are output,
ranging from 1 to 25000.  The number and maximum can be changed by modifying
nk and ellkapmax, respectively, in hyphi.cc. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile-time options:

* eabs_P and erel_P
Absolute and relative error tolerances for power spectrum integration, eabs_P
and erel_P, are set in hyphi.cc and may be modified at compile time.  Currently
they are set to 1e-15 and 1e-06, respectively, for a running time on a standard
desktop machine of about 2 seconds.

* PRINTPMAT
Matter power spectra over nk logarithmically-spaced k values may be printed 
after the lensing potential power spectrum by setting PRINTPMAT=1 in hyphi.cc.

* SWITCH_TRANSFER_TYPE
hyphi can accept old-format 7-column CAMB transfer functions by setting
SWITCH_TRANSFER_TYPE=1 in AU_cosmological_parameters.h.  This setting also
accepts CLASS transfer functions with the format=camb option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:

Three example calculations for a Planck-like model with three equal-mass 
neutrinos of total mass M_nu = 0.24 eV are provided in the examples directory:

* TRG: Time-RG perturbation theory is used to compute CDM and baryon clustering
    at all redshifts.  CAMB transfer function files have also been provided,
    so that hyphi can simply be run from the command line: ./hyphi

* MT4+TRG: hyphi switches from Time-RG clustering at redshifts z>2 to the Mira-
    Titan emulator at lower redshifts for greater accuracy.

* MT4+TRG+SP(k): Each of the three hydrodynamic options above is tested 
    simultaneously, with the fiducial BAHAMAS baryon fraction and the mean
    model of Akino shown to agree to <1.3% to L=10000.  This example also
    demonstrates the computation of multiple lensing potential power spectra
    at once, in parallel.  

CAMB transfer files are the same in all three examples and may be copied from 
the TRG directory to the other two.  In each case, the hyphi output is saved as
hyphi_planckLargeNuFix.dat.
